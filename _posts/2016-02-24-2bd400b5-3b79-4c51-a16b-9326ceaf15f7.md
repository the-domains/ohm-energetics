From ancient times, the great teachers have all understood this very important truth:

**YOUR THOUGHTS CREATE YOUR REALITY!**

What's more, Quantum Physics has also revealed that everything is created through the vibration of energy.

It is mind-boggling to realize that we are all simultaneously waves of energy and particles of matter manifesting in reality as conscious beings.

Are you aware that your thoughts hold the potential for limitless possibilities? 

When you are in control of your thought process, you can learn to solve problems differently and create a new reality.

But, don't take my word for it.

Listen to the teachers:

* "The energy of the mind is the essence of life." ~ Aristotle

* "All we are is a result of what we have thought.The mind is everything.What we think, we become." ~ Buddha

* "Everything is energy and that's all there is to it. Match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get that reality. It can be no other way. This is not philosophy. This is physics." ~ Albert Einstein

* "Our thoughts shape our perceptions.Our perceptions shape our reality." ~ Deepak Chopra
